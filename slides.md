# Linear Regression in Machine Learning

Linear regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning, allowing us to model and analyze the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

---

# Overview of Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous outcomes based on one or more predictor variables.

---

# Key Concepts

* **Dependent Variable (Target Variable)**: The variable we want to predict.
* **Independent Variables (Feature Variables)**: The variables used to make predictions.

---

# The Linear Regression Equation

The linear regression equation takes the form of:

y = β₀ + β₁x + ε

Where:
* y is the dependent variable
* β₀ is the intercept or bias term
* β₁ is the slope coefficient
* x is the independent variable
* ε is the error term

# How Linear Regression Works

The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

---

# Model Training Process

### Cost Function

The cost function, also known as the loss function, measures the difference between predicted and actual values.

### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function and find the optimal parameters for our model.

---

# Evaluation Metrics

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RMSE measures the average distance between predicted and actual values.

### R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

R² score measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

# Use Cases and Limitations

### Use Cases

* Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., stock prices, temperatures)
* Identifying relationships between variables

### Limitations

* Assumes linearity between variables
* Sensitive to outliers and missing values

# Examples and Visualizations

### Simple Linear Regression Example

Predicting house prices based on the number of bedrooms.

### Multiple Linear Regression Example

Predicting stock prices based on multiple economic indicators.

### Visualization: Scatter Plot with Regression Line

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

# Regression line
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Data Points')
plt.plot([0, 6], [0, 10], label='Regression Line')

plt.xlabel('Independent Variable')
plt.ylabel('Dependent Variable')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression Example')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

Linear regression is a powerful tool in machine learning, allowing us to model and analyze complex relationships between variables. By understanding the key concepts, equation, and evaluation metrics, we can effectively train and deploy linear regression models to make accurate predictions.

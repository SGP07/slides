# Introduction to Quantum Computing

**Classical Computing vs. Quantum Computing**

* Classical computing: bits, 0s and 1s
* Quantum computing: qubits, 0s, 1s, and **superpositions** of 0s and 1s

**Key Concepts:**

* **Qubits**: quantum bits, the fundamental units of quantum information
* **Superposition**: qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously
* **Entanglement**: qubits can be connected, affecting each other's states

# Quantum Bits (Qubits)

**Classical Bits vs. Qubits**

* Classical bits: 0 or 1
* Qubits: 0, 1, or **both** (superposition)

**Parallel Computation with Qubits**

* Qubits enable massive parallelization, exponentially faster computation
